            <h2>Madison</h2>
            <p>I'm currently in Madison finishing my Computer Science & Data Science studies at UW-Madison. Most of my time is focused on hands-on data analysis projects and earning a Consulting Certificate. I'm exploring how technology and analytics drive practical business results and preparing to move into a data or business analyst role.</p>
